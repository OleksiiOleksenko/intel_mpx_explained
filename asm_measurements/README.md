# Installation

*Note:* this tool doesn't seem to work in a container

First run `get_framework.sh`, then `install.sh` (run both from **this** directory).
Experiments should be ready to run afterwards, although not guaranteed.

If you have any issues, try doing the installation manually:
Put the experiment files (.sh1 and .inc) into the `TestScripts` directory inside the Agner Fog's testing framework.
The framework itself can be found [here](http://www.agner.org/optimize/testp.zip).
The instructions for running the script can be found in the framework documentation.

# Running the experiment

In `TestScripts`:

```
> ./_mpx.sh1
```
